# Getting the project bootstrapped.

Before the list of commands to get the app up and running enumerated, I would like to give 
a brief description of about the technical test task. although the project was structured 
in a production format but based on the specification requirement. 

so the following technologies where used:

- Reactjs with some inline styling 

- ES6 

- React-redux

- Webpack ....for bundling the modules using the different loaders.

- Modular css with the help of loaders using webpack

- Vanila Javascript [do not have to use it but because I can].
 
- Boostrap and Jquery Frameworks would have made my life easier but they where avoided because of the task reqirements


#### But I must say though, it seems as if there where 2 versions of the task requirement, one in a PDF file and that in the REAME.md file.



#### OK, let's install the require dependencies by using the command.
```
*** npm install
```

#### use the command webpack to build our modules and load them into the /dist folder.
```
*** webpack
```
I have added the line...

```
*** watch: true 
```
to run the webpack.config.js to watch any changes made to our files

to see the output of the project:

[http://localhost/OnTheBeachTest/dist/](http://localhost/OnTheBeachTest/dist/)


```
*** http://localhost/OnTheBeachTest/dist/ 
```
